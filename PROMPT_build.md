# Building Mode Prompt

Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to understand current tasks and priorities.

Your task is to:
1. Select the highest priority incomplete task (marked with [ ])
2. Implement the selected task completely
3. Run validation to verify your implementation works
4. Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to mark the task as complete [x]

Focus on:
- Writing clean, well-tested code
- Following existing code patterns and conventions
- Keeping changes minimal and focused
- Ensuring all validation checks pass before marking complete
