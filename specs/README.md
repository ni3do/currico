# Specifications Directory

This directory contains specifications for what should be built.

## How to Use

1. Add markdown files describing features, requirements, or user stories
2. Each file should describe a cohesive piece of functionality
3. Include acceptance criteria where possible

## Example Structure

```
specs/
├── README.md           # This file
├── feature-auth.md     # Authentication feature spec
├── feature-api.md      # API endpoints spec
└── requirements.md     # General requirements
```

## Writing Good Specs

- Be specific about expected behavior
- Include examples where helpful
- Define edge cases and error handling
- Specify any constraints or dependencies
