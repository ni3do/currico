## Overview

Allow logged-in users to save resources and bundles to a personal wishlist for later purchase.

## Adding to Wishlist

### Interaction Points
- Subtle heart icon on catalog cards
- "Save" link on detail pages
- Available for both resources and bundles

### Requirements
- User must be logged in
- Visual feedback on save action

## Wishlist Page

### Design Principles
- Intentionally simple
- Clean list of saved items
- No extra tabs or complex filtering
- Preserve UI clarity

### Item Display
Each item shows:
- Key details (title, subject, price)
- Prominent primary CTA:
  - "Buy" if not purchased
  - "Open" if already owned

### Secondary Actions
- "Remove from Wishlist" as small text link
- Maintains visual focus on main action

## UI Guidelines

- Heart icon or "Save" link should be subtle but discoverable
- Primary CTA uses distinct primary color
- Remove action is visually subdued
