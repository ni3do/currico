          Here are the files changed in this PR:
          $DIFF

          Read CLAUDE.md and spec/index.md. Check if any changes in this PR would make the documentation inaccurate or incomplete.

          If docs need updating, exit with code 1 and explain what needs to change.
          If docs are still accurate, exit with code 0 and say 'Docs are up to date.'

          Only flag genuine inaccuracies — don't flag missing docs for minor internal changes." \
