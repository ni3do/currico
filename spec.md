Key Features The tools and functions that enable users to accomplish core tasks.

1. Teacher & School Account Management Provide registration and login for both individual teachers and school accounts. Teachers create personal accounts with profile data (name, canton, preferred cycles, subjects). School accounts are created by a school admin, who manages school details and invites teacher users. Users can belong to a school account while maintaining their personal profile. UI forms are visually simple and vertically stacked, with ample whitespace and minimal fields on each screen. Primary actions like "Create Account" or "Save Changes" use a distinct primary color, while cancel or secondary actions are subdued.

2. School Accounts with Team Licenses Allow school accounts to purchase resources and bundles with a "school/team license" that grants access to all teachers in that school. School admins can invite or remove teachers and view which resources and bundles the school owns in a shared 'School Library'. The interface is kept clean with grouped sections (Members, Licenses, Billing) and only the essential information shown by default, with optional details placed in expandable rows or secondary screens.

3. Resource Catalog & Clean Advanced Search Display a catalog of individual resources and bundles in a clean grid or list, with only the core information on cards: title, short description, main subject, price, quality status, and a clear primary CTA (e.g., "View" or "Buy"). On the search page, show just two main controls by default: a wide search bar (keywords) and a main subject selector. All additional filters (cycle, canton, quality status, price type, resource type, editable, license scope, Lehrplan 21 competence codes) are hidden inside a collapsible "More Filters" section. When opened, this section presents filters in neatly grouped, well-spaced blocks with simple typography, avoiding visual clutter. Sorting options (e.g., Newest, Most Downloaded) are displayed as a small, unobtrusive control. On mobile, the "More Filters" appears as a bottom sheet or slide-out panel, while the visible search bar and subject selector remain prominently at the top.

4. Resource Detail Pages with Quality, Editability, Secure Previews, Reporting & Related Resources Each resource has a clean, uncluttered detail page that highlights essential information at the top: title, brief description, price, primary CTA (Buy/Download in a distinct color), and key badges (quality status, editability, type). Secondary meta-information—subject, cycle, canton, Lehrplan 21 competence codes—is displayed below in a neatly spaced metadata block. Preview content is shown in a simple gallery with watermarked or low-resolution previews clearly labeled as such. Seller info, wishlist and follow buttons are present but visually secondary. A "Report Resource" link or button appears near the bottom of the info section and opens a minimal report form. A "Related Resources" block at the end shows a small list of cards for other resources or bundles sharing at least one common attribute; if too few, it falls back to same-subject items. Layout uses generous padding and only a few accent colors so the primary actions stand out without visual noise.

5. Resource Bundles for Discounted Packages Allow sellers to combine multiple existing resources into discounted "Bundles" with their own title, description, cover image, and price. Bundles can inherit or manually specify curriculum tags such as subject, cycle, and competence codes. Bundle detail pages mirror the clean layout of individual resources, featuring a clear summary area with a single main CTA (Buy/Download) in the primary color, then a concise list of included items in a simple, readable stack. Bundle creation forms follow the same stepwise, low-clutter pattern as single resource uploads, exposing only relevant fields per step.

6. Multi-Stage Resource Upload Workflow with Competence Codes Provide a guided, multi-step upload process for resources: (1) Basics (title, short description, language, resource type), (2) Curriculum (cycle, main subject, canton, structured Lehrplan 21 competence codes chosen from searchable dropdowns), (3) Properties (price type, price, editability, license scope), and (4) Files & Preview (upload files, preview files with watermark/low-res mode) and publish. Each step shows only a focused subset of fields, preventing form overload. Steps are clearly labeled with a minimal UI progress indicator. The primary navigation buttons ("Next", "Publish") use the platform's main accent color, while "Back" and "Cancel" are understated text or ghost buttons.

7. Quality Status Management Allow admins to update the Quality Status (Pending, AI-Checked, Verified) of resources in a simple, minimalist admin view. Admins see a clean list of resources with just a few columns (Title, Seller, Current Status, Last Updated) and can open an item to change its status and optionally add an internal note. The design avoids dense tables; on smaller screens, each resource appears as a card with key info and a clear "Change Status" button.

8. Transaction & Commission Management Handle purchases for resources and bundles with automatic splitting between platform fee and seller payout. An admin settings page allows configuration of a global Platform Commission Rate via a single, clearly labeled field. Each transaction stores gross amount, platform fee, and seller payout. Admin transaction views prioritize readability—showing only essential columns and allowing drill-down for details—keeping visual elements sparse and easy to scan. Primary actions such as 'Update Commission Rate' use the primary accent color, while everything else stays understated.

9. Purchase, Download & Libraries (Personal and School) Enable purchase and download of individual resources and bundles, recording purchases for teachers or school accounts. After purchase, users can access full-resolution files from "My Library" (personal) or "School Library" (shared). Each library page lists items in a simple card or row format: title, subject, a couple of badges (e.g., Quality, Editability), and a single primary action button (Download/Open) in the distinct primary color. Advanced metadata and history are available on detail pages rather than cluttering library lists. Preview files remain watermarked or low-res unless the user owns the item.

10. Wishlist for Resources and Bundles Allow logged-in users to add resources and bundles to a personal wishlist via a subtle heart icon or "Save" link on cards and detail pages. The wishlist page is intentionally simple: a clean list of saved items with only key details and a prominent primary CTA for each (e.g., "Buy" if not purchased, "Open" if already owned). Secondary actions like "Remove from Wishlist" are small text links to maintain visual focus on the main action. No extra tabs or complex filtering are introduced in the wishlist to preserve UI clarity.

11. Follow Seller & Simple Upload Notifications Allow users to follow sellers through a simple "Follow" button on their profile or on resource detail pages. A clean "Updates" or "Following" section lists new resources and bundles from followed sellers in reverse chronological order, using a straightforward vertical list with minimal metadata (item title, seller, date). Notifications are intentionally low-noise: no cluttered badges or notification types beyond what is necessary for MVP. Primary links ("View Resource") are clearly styled, whereas follow/unfollow toggles remain subtle but discoverable.

12. Seller Dashboard for Net Earnings, Downloads, Bundles & Followers Provide a consolidated Seller Dashboard with a focus on clarity over data density. At the top, show a few key metrics as large, clean stats: Net Earnings, Total Downloads, Followers. Below, present a list of resources and bundles; each row/card shows title, status, and one or two key numbers (e.g., downloads, net earnings). A secondary view lists recent transactions with gross, platform fee, and seller payout, but limited to essential columns. Action buttons like "Edit Resource" or "Create Bundle" use the primary accent color and are spaced generously to avoid crowding.

13. Basic Reviews & Ratings Allow buyers to leave a star rating and a brief text review. Reviews are displayed under a simple heading, using a minimal layout: star rating, reviewer name, short comment, and date. No complex threading or reactions are included. The main resource content remains visually dominant; the reviews block is separated with whitespace and a subtle divider so it doesn't overwhelm the page.

14. Report Resource & Admin Review Dashboard Include a "Report Resource" button on resource and bundle detail pages that opens a compact form where users select a reason and add an optional comment. In the admin area, list reported resources in a simple, filterable view showing resource title, report reason, status, and date. Admins can open each report to change its status (Open, In Review, Resolved, Dismissed). Interfaces avoid dense data tables and keep the number of visible elements small by default to adhere to the clean UI philosophy.
